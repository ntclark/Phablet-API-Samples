This project shows how to use the Phablet API to create a full featured and rich interface on an Android pad
that interfaces directly back to the windows application.

In this model, the Android Phablet is acting as a remote "terminal" for your windows application. But as far as
an Android user is concerned - they would think that an entire custom Android App has been created for them
and running on the Phablet.

This is an entirely new approach to application development for Android - you can very easily continue to develop
your application(s) on Windows using familiar technologies - yet "deploy" to Android devices anywhere within 
network availability.

It is not intended <i>just</i> to ease application deployment on Android ! Consider, for example, a PC based server system
running on a centrally located computer - with ALL access to established business logic AND enterprise resources - such as
database - servicing hundreds of Android "terminals" - with absolutely zero re-deployment cost when anything changes.

The possibilities are endless ...
