This project is an extremely simple C++ single dialog windows application.

It demonstrates how easy it is to create a simple windows application using the raw Win32 API, that is, without any sort of "get in your face" framework.

In terms of using the InnoVisioNate Phablet API as a signature capture device, this example could not be easier.

It simply instantiates the interface and uses it. It does <i>not</i> deal with embedding controls, or ActiveX or ANY 
other un-necessary complexity if ALL you want to do is get a signature.
